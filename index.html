                <p>A <em>Web Developer</em> is a programmer who specializes in, or is specifically engaged in,
                     the development of World Wide Web applications using a clientâ€“server model.
                     The applications typically use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#) or
                      Java in the server, and http for communications between client and server.
                     A web content management system is often used to develop and maintain web applications.</p>

                <h4>Nature of Employment</h4>

                <p>Web developers are found working in various types of organizations, including large corporations
                     and governments, small and medium-sized companies, or alone as freelancers.
                     Some web developers work for one organization as a permanent full-time employee, while others

                      Web developers typically handle both server-side and front-end logic. 
                      This usually involves implementing all the visual elements that users see and use in the
                       web applications or use, as well as all the web services that are necessary to power the usage of their developing work.
                     Salaries vary depending on the type of development work, location, and level of seniority.</p>
