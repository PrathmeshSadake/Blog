                <h2>Type of work performed</h2>
                <p>Modern web applications often contain three or more tiers, and depending on the size of the team a developer
                  orks on, he or she may specialize in one or more of these tiers - or may take a more interdisciplinary role.
                    A web developer is usually classified as a Front-end web development or a Back-End Web Developer. For example,
                    in a two-person team, one developer may focus on the technologies sent to the client such as HTML, JavaScript,
                    CSS, ReactJs or AngularJS and on the server-side frameworks (such as Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, ASP,
                    ASP.NET, Node.js) used to deliver content and scripts to the client. Meanwhile, the other developer might
                    focus on the interaction between server-side frameworks, the webserver, and a database system. Further,
                    depending on the size of their organization, the aforementioned developers might work closely with a
                     content creator/copywriter, marketing adviser, user experience designer, web designer, web producer,
                     project manager, software architect, or database administrator - or they may be responsible for such tasks as web design and project management themselves.</p>
